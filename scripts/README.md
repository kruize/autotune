# Installation

## Kubernetes

Autotune can be deployed to a supported Kubernetes cluster. We currently support Minikube and OpenShift.

### Minikube


```
$ ./deploy.sh -c minikube

Info: Access grafana dashboard to see autotune recommendations at http://localhost:3000 <--- Click on this link to access grafana dashboards
Info: Run the following command first to access grafana port
      $ kubectl port-forward -n monitoring grafana-58dc7468d7-rn7nx 3000:3000		<---- But run this command first

```

After the installation completes successfully, run the `port-forward` command as shown. This is needed to access the grafana service. Now click on the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access grafana. Login as `admin/admin`, navigate to `Create` from the left bar, then click on `Import`. Click on `Upload .json file` and point it to the [dashboard](/grafana/autotune_kubernetes_dashboard.json) file that is part of this repo. Once installed, select `autotune Dashboard`. Select the application name from the `Deployment` drop down and you are all set !

Note: autotune only monitors application with a specific label. See [Add Application Label](#add-application-label) below for more info.

$ ./deploy.sh -c openshift
