# Bulk API Documentation

Bulk is an API designed to provide resource optimization recommendations in bulk for all available
containers, namespaces, etc., for a cluster connected via the datasource integration framework. Bulk can
be configured using filters like exclude/include namespaces, workloads, containers, or labels for generating
recommendations. It also has settings to generate recommendations at both the container or namespace level, or both.

Bulk returns a `jobID` as a response to track the job status. The user can use the `jobID` to monitor the
progress of the job.

## Task Flow When Bulk Is Invoked

1. Returns a unique `jobID`.
2. Background Bulk:
    - First, does a handshake with the datasource.
    - Using queries, it fetches the list of namespaces, workloads, containers of the connected datasource.
    - Creates experiments, one for each container *alpha release.
    - Triggers `generateRecommendations` for each container.
    - Once all experiments are created, and recommendations are generated, the system marks the `jobID` as "COMPLETED".

## API Specification

### POST /bulk

**Request Payload (JSON):**

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "exclude": {
      "namespace": [],
      "workload": [],
      "containers": [],
      "labels": {}
    },
    "include": {
      "namespace": [],
      "workload": [],
      "containers": [],
      "labels": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
      }
    }
  },
  "time_range": {
        "start": "",
        "end": ""
  },
  "datasource": "Cbank1Xyz",
  "experiment_types": [
    "container",
    "namespace"
  ]
}
```

**filter:** This object contains both exclusion and inclusion filters to specify the scope of data being queried.

- **exclude:** Defines the criteria to exclude certain data.
    - **namespace:** A list of Kubernetes namespaces to exclude. If empty, no namespaces are excluded.
    - **workload:** A list of workloads to exclude.
    - **containers:** A list of container names to exclude.
    - **labels:** Key-value pairs of labels to exclude.

- **include:** Defines the criteria to include specific data.
    - **namespace:** A list of Kubernetes namespaces to include.
    - **workload:** A list of workloads to include.
    - **containers:** A list of container names to include.
    - **labels:** Key-value pairs of labels to include.

- **time_range:** Specifies the time range for querying the data. If empty, no specific time range is applied.

- **datasource:** The data source, e.g., `"Cbank1Xyz"`.

- **experiment_types:** Specifies the type(s) of experiments to run, e.g., `"container"` or `"namespace"`.

### Success Response
